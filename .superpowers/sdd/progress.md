# Subagent-Driven Development Progress

## Active workspace

- Worktree: `F:/da/shubao/.worktrees/codex-ecommerce-stability`
- Branch: `codex/ecommerce-stability`
- Approved Git prefix: `git -c safe.directory=F:/da/shubao/.worktrees/codex-ecommerce-stability -C .worktrees/codex-ecommerce-stability`

## Completed foundations

- Design committed: `7bf42b5` (`docs: design generation and billing platform`).
- Implementation plans committed: `ada0b30` (`docs: plan generation and billing implementation`).
- Collaboration root-cause audit: absolute `-C` commands missed the approved prefix; tracked `dist/` and SQLite runtime files kept the worktree dirty.

## Current execution

- Long-term collaboration protocol and runtime-boundary cleanup: complete in the commit named `chore: establish durable AI collaboration protocol`.
- Billing Ledger Task 1: complete (`b6b9881..defeda7`, spec compliant, quality approved, focused 4/4 and full 135/135 tests passed).
- Billing Ledger Task 2: complete (`90bedce..fccb9bf`, three-commit review/fix loop clean, focused 13/13 and full 148/148 tests passed).
- Billing Ledger Task 3: complete (`c0410c6..7d1947b`, four-commit review/fix loop clean, focused 29/29 and full 176/176 tests passed).
- Billing Ledger Task 4: complete (`683901e..a12044a`, three-commit review/fix loop approved, focused 15/15, wallet regression 43/43, full 191/191 tests passed).
- Billing Ledger Task 5: complete (`8cd41f9..0394c00`, two-commit review/fix loop approved, focused 16/16, wallet 28/28, payment 15/15, full 207/207 tests passed).
- Billing Ledger Task 6: complete (`c55a33f..8eb9e30`, generation-job idempotency, signed identity, disconnect-safe durable replay, isolated one-cover previews, stable URL/data/Base64 persistence, and fenced lease heartbeat independently reviewed and approved; focused 35/35, billing regression 107/107, full 242/242 tests passed).
- Next implementation task: Billing Ledger plan, Task 7.

## Ownership

- Codex owns: `server/`, existing application pages, API integration, database, deployment, and all plan execution unless delegated explicitly.
- GLM reserved scope for the next independent handoff only: `src/components/billing/` new presentational files and `test/billing-ui-model.test.mjs` as listed in the paid workflow plan.
- No overlapping implementation agents may run concurrently.

## Minor findings backlog

- Billing Task 4: a second process holding the SQLite write lock can surface `SQLITE_BUSY` from order creation; correctness remains protected, but route-level retryable error mapping should be added during Billing API integration.
- Billing Task 6: route-boundary source parsing in `test/content-billing.test.mjs` is brittle under large route refactors; replace it with an app-factory route test when `server/index.mjs` is decomposed. Non-blocking for Task 6 because injected runner behavior tests cover the critical lifecycle.
